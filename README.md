# Beautiful Login Form using Tkinter

This is a simple and visually appealing login form created using Python's Tkinter library. It demonstrates how to create a modern-looking GUI with username and password fields, and basic login validation.

## üñºÔ∏è GUI Features

- Custom window size and centered login frame
- Clean design using `Frame`, `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button` widgets
- Placeholder login check for:
  - **Username:** `admin`
  - **Password:** `1234`
- Success and error alerts using `messagebox`
- Footer copyright

## üß† How it Works

- When the user enters the correct credentials (`admin` / `1234`), a success message is shown.
- If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.

## üõ† Requirements

No external libraries are needed. This script uses the built-in `tkinter` module.

Make sure you're using **Python 3.x**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Save the code to a file named something like `login_gui.py`.
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python login_gui.py
